# Mastering Apache Storm
This is the code repository for [Mastering Apache Storm](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/mastering-apache-storm?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787125636), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Apache Storm is a real-time Big Data processing framework that processes large amounts of data reliably, guaranteeing that every message will be processed. Storm allows you to scale your data as it grows, making it an excellent platform to solve your big data problems. This extensive guide will help you understand right from the basics to the advanced topics of Storm.

The book begins with a detailed introduction to real-time processing and where Storm fits in to solve these problems. You’ll get an understanding of deploying Storm on clusters by writing a basic Storm Hello World example. Next we’ll introduce you to Trident and you’ll get a clear understanding of how you can develop and deploy a trident topology. We cover topics such as monitoring, Storm Parallelism, scheduler and log processing, in a very easy to understand manner. You will also learn how to integrate Storm with other well-known Big Data technologies such as HBase, Redis, Kafka, and Hadoop to realize the full potential of Storm.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.storm</groupId>
  <artifactId>storm-core</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.2</version>
  <scope>provided<scope>
</dependency>
```

All of the code in this book has been tested on CentOS 6.5. It will run on other variants of
Linux and Windows as well with appropriate changes in commands.
We have tried to keep the chapters self-contained, and the setup and installation of all the
software used in each chapter are included in the chapter itself. These are the software
packages used throughout the book:
* CentOS 6.5
* Oracle JDK 8
* Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.6
* Apache Storm 1.0.2
* Eclipse or Spring Tool Suite
* Elasticsearch 2.4.4
* Hadoop 2.2.2
